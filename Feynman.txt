***************************************************************************************************************************************

“Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter.
Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.”

“Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.”

“You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish.
I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.”
― Richard P. Feynman, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character

“Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter.
Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. 
Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best.
Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do.
Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.”
― Richard P. Feynman

“I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”
― Richard P. Feynman

“I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong.
I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, ...
...but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about,...
...such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here. 
I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose,...
...which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.”
